# Moguls of Chaos

What are the moguls and why are they related to chaos? Mogul skiing is a ski discipline that consists of descending a slope full of small regular bumps. Ed Lorenz discovered that the objects descending the moguls have chaotic behavior. The aim of this project is to perform the small numerical experiment for describing the dynamics of an idealized sled going down the moguls.

I will use this project as training for my very rusty Julia skills. As a backup plan, if everything fails, I will write the code in Python.

## Objectives

- [ ] Build the code in Julia.
- [ ] Build the code in Python.
- [ ] Try parallelization in Julia for an ensemble of initial conditions.
