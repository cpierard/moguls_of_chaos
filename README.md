# Moguls of Chaos

What are the moguls and why are they related to Chaos? The moguls are a ski discipline that consists of descending a slope full of small regular bumps. Ed Lorenz discovered that the objects descending the moguls have a chaotic behavior. The aim of this project is to perform the small numerical experiment for describing the dynamics of an idealized sled going down the moguls.

I will use this project as training for my very rusty Julia skills. As a backup plan, if everything fails, I will write the code in Python.

## Objectives

- [ ] Build the code in Julia.
- [ ] Build the code in Python.
- [ ] Try parallelization in Julia for an ensemble of initial conditions.
