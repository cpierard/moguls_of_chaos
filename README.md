# Moguls of Chaos

What are the moguls and why are they related to chaos? Mogul skiing is a ski discipline that consists of descending a slope full of small regular bumps. Ed Lorenz discovered that the objects descending the moguls have chaotic behavior. The aim of this project is to perform the small numerical experiment for describing the dynamics of an idealized sled going down the moguls.

This is a project for my Scientific computing class. I started this small project two years ago after reading *The Essence of Chaos* by E. Lorenz, but I couldn't finish it. So, I will use this project for my project of Sci. Comp. and as training for my very rusty Julia skills. In parallel, I will do the code in Python.

## Structure

You will find two Jupyter notebooks, one written in Julia and the other in Python. Both notebooks are similar and solve the same exercises. If you want to run one of this notebooks, I will suggest to run the Julia one, because is way faster, especially for computing the bifurcation diagram.

Also, I put the explanation and the results in a blog post that you can find here ...

## Objectives

- [x] Build the code in Julia.
- [x] Build the code in Python.
- [ ] ~Try parallelization in Julia for an ensemble of initial conditions.
